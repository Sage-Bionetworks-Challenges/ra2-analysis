# RA2 DREAM Challenge Analysis
The purpose of the [RA2-DREAM Challenge](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn20545111/wiki/594083) is to develop an automated method to quickly and accurately quantify the degree of joint damage associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Based on radiographs of the hands and feet, a novel, automated scoring method could be applied broadly for patient care and research. We challenge participants to develop algorithms to automatically assess joint space narrowing and erosions using a large set of existing radiographs with damage scores generated by visual assessment of images by trained readers using standard protocols. The end result will be a generalizable, publicly available, automated method to generate accurate, reproducible and unbiased RA damage scores to replace the current tedious, expensive, and non-scalable method of scoring by human visual inspection.

This project contains post-challenge statistical analyses.
